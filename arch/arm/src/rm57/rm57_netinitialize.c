/* Single owner of arm_netinitialize() for this port.
 *
 * arm_internal.h declares arm_netinitialize() (and arm_initialize.c calls
 * it unconditionally from up_initialize()) whenever CONFIG_NET is set and
 * CONFIG_NETDEV_LATEINIT is NOT set; with CONFIG_NETDEV_LATEINIT, board
 * bring-up code registers network devices itself instead (see
 * boards/arm/rm57/rm57l843-launchxl2/src/rm57_can.c and
 * src/rm57_ethernet.c), typically because it wants to supply a real MAC
 * address rather than this file's placeholder one.
 *
 * Both of this port's netdev-capable drivers (SocketCAN over DCAN,
 * rm57_dcan_sock.c; and the EMAC, rm57_ethernet.c) previously each
 * defined arm_netinitialize() themselves, which only worked because at
 * most one was ever built at a time.  Enabling both together would fail
 * to link (duplicate symbol), so this symbol now has exactly one owner.

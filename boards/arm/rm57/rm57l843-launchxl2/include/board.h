/* EMAC/MDIO.
 *
 * Most MII signals on RM57L843 exist on two balls: a dedicated one that
 * carries nothing else, and an alternate that is shared with N2HET1/
 * MIBSPI.  For signals that are inputs to the MCU an input-select entry
 * (PINMUX_SIG_<signal>_<ball>_PIN, PINMMR87-91) picks which of the two
 * the peripheral actually listens to; for outputs a function-select
 * entry (PINMUX_<ball>_<signal>_PIN, PINMMR0-36) switches that ball to
 * the signal.  Balls that are dedicated need neither.
 *
 * This board wires Ethernet entirely to the dedicated set.  Read off the
 * docs/sprr397.pdf schematic, sheet 3 (U1B, MCU pinout):
 *
 *   MDIO   F4    MDCLK  T9    MII_TXCLK U7   MII_RXCLK T4
 *   MII_COL W4   MII_CRS V4   MII_RX_DV U6   MII_RX_ER U5
 *   MII_RXD[0..3] U4 T3 U3 V3
 *   MII_TXD[0..3] U8 R1 T2 G4   MII_TXEN E4
 *
 * The shared alternates (G3 for MDIO, V5 for MDCLK, K19/B11/N19/P1/A14/
 * G19/H18/F3/B4/D19/E18/R2/J19/J18/H19 for the data path) are drawn on
 * sheet 3 too, but their nets run to the BoosterPack headers on sheets
 * 7/8/14 - not to the PHY.
 *
 * That leaves almost nothing to program: every PINMMR byte resets to
 * 01h, which already selects exactly the dedicated balls this board
 * uses.  An earlier version of this table selected the *alternate* ball
 * (02h) for every MII input, which pointed the MAC's receive path at
 * BoosterPack pins and silently broke RX.
 *
 * The one entry that is genuinely required is the MII/RMII selector:
 * PINMMR160[24] resets to 1 = RMII (SPNU562A Section 6.5.3), and this
 * board is hard-wired for MII - the DP83630's MII_MODE strap (RX_DV) is
 * pulled low by RP11C on sheet 12, and there is no jumper to change it.
 *
 * The explicit SIG_* input-selects below are redundant with the reset
 * value but are kept so this table documents the ball choice rather than
 * relying on a silent default.
